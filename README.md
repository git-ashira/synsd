# SynSD
Transformer-based framework for predicting ribosome binding site (RBS) and spacer sequences from annotated genomes. Includes data extraction, training, evaluation, and inference utilities for generating synthetic RBS sequences to aid synthetic biology design.


This repository uses python to manage the SynSD pipeline.
